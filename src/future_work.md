# Future Work

Future work is largely tracked by the issues and PRs marked ‚ùå on the [issue summary page], and can also be seen in the `amethyst` repository's [WASM project] and on the issue tracker under the ["WASM Support"] tag.

Notable items are:

* [Firefox support]
* [Flakey issues]
* [Parallel execution]

These are necessary for applications to "just work" across major browsers and OSes, and work performantly.
